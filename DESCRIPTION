Description: Provides functions to access data from public RESTful APIs including 
    'World Bank API', and 'REST Countries API', retrieving real-time or historical 
    data related to India, such as economic indicators, and international 
    demographic and geopolitical indicators. Additionally, the package includes one of the largest 
    curated collections of open datasets focused on India, covering topics such as population, economy, weather, politics, health, biodiversity, sports, agriculture, cybercrime, infrastructure, and more. The package supports reproducible research and teaching by integrating 
    reliable international APIs and structured datasets from public, academic, and government sources.
